#Threadbare

##Base Code

This is base code I use in game jams with ([Flaxen](https://github.com/Scriptorum/Flaxen)).
There's not a lot to it: it's just a basic framework to get Flaxen up and running in a game jam.
Threadbare provides a project file, asset folders, an inappropriate icon (I stole HaxePunk's), a default font, 
art assets necessary to display the HaxePunk console, and some bootstrap code. The code provides a basic Flaxen handler, displays a blank 600x600 window, and binds a key that will dump information about all the entities to entities.txt 
when D is pressed.
