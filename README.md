#Threadbare

This is base code I use in game jams. It's a framework to get [Flaxen](https://github.com/Scriptorum/Flaxen) up and running.

##Contents
Threadbare includes...
* A project file
* Asset folders
* An inappropriate icon (I stole HaxePunk's)
* A default pixel TTF font, 04B_03 (also stolen from HaxePunk) and [Accidental Presidency](http://www.tepidmonkey.net)
* Art assets necessary to display the HaxePunk console
* A custom Inscrutable Games preloader
* Some bootstrap code

And the code...
* Provides a basic Flaxen handler that shows a red dot (exciting!)
* Displays a 600x600 window with a centered image
* Binds a key that will log information about all the entities when D is pressed
