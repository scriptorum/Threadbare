#Threadbare

This is base code I use in game jams. 
There's not a lot to it, it's just a basic framework to get [Flaxen](https://github.com/Scriptorum/Flaxen) up and running.

##Contents
Threadbare includes...
* A project file
* Asset folders
* An inappropriate icon (I stole HaxePunk's)
* A default TTF font (also HaxePunk's)
* Art assets necessary to display the HaxePunk console
* Some bootstrap code

And the code...
* Provides a basic Flaxen handler
* Displays a blank 600x600 window
* Binds a key that will dump information about all the entities to entities.txt when D is pressed
